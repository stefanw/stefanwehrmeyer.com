The Caribbean Open Institute at the Mona Business school of the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica wanted to know more about CKAN and OpenSpending. As one of the only people at the Open Knowledge Foundation who has sufficient experience with both, I was sent to Kingston.

I met a couple of interesting people that I will surely meet again one day. I also enjoyed a visit to Kingston and Port Royal.
