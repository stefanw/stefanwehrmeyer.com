I teamed up with [freelance data journalist Michael HÃ¶rz](http://www.michael-hoerz.de/) to visualize the Federal FOI statistic for ZEIT and ZEIT Online. The concept came from ZEIT, I did the D3 visualization and Michael took care of quality assurance and communications.

The very detail-oriented approach of ZEIT made some custom D3-hoop-jumping necessary, but it worked out neatly.
