At re:publica 2013 [Julia Kloiber](http://juliakloiber.com/) and I gave a talk about „Open Data: what's it got to do with me?“ (in German). You can find [the slides here](https://speakerdeck.com/stefanw/open-data-und-was-hat-mit-mir-zu-tun) (beautifully designed by Julia) and [the whole talk on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBSNr6UXIJg).

I also ran a workshop on FOI with [Michael Hörz](http://www.michael-hoerz.de/) and Ansgar Koreng to encourage people to make FOI requests and blog about them.
