[BudgIT](http://yourbudgit.com/), a company based in Lagos, Nigeria that tackles the Nigerian Budget from different angles, wanted a CKAN and OpenSpending training. So I traveled to Lagos, paid my first bribe ever at the airport (shout out to shady yellow fever official) and spent a terrific ten days in Lagos.

Together with BudgIT staff, staff from Edo State and from the Federal government, we worked at the [Co-Creation Hub](http://cchubnigeria.com/) and got through quite a bit of topics: CKAN customizations, OpenSpending dataset loading, Refine and some visualization tools to top it off.

The hospitality was amazing and I left Lagos with a slightly better understanding of the African continent.
