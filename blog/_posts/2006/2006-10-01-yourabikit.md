YAK was originally created for the yearbook of my own high school graduation. It helps yearbook editors to collect profile info, pictures, votes, comments and texts from their fellow students.

I wrote it in 2006 in PHP and the little programming knowledge I had back then. I rewrote some of it in 2007 to be more Ajax. Fun times! The integration with Desktop Publishing programs like Scribus and InDesign makes the online data collection worth it, because all data can then be automatically placed into a template for each student instead of copying and pasting.

Despite its odd name and looks, it is quite popular attracting thousands of users and going stronger each year.
