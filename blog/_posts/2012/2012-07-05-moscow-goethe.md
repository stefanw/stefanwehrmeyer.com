The Goethe Institute Moscow invited me to join a panel at [Strelka Institute](http://www.strelka.com/?lang=en) about Co-Working, Collaboration and Open Data (quite a mix).

I flew in with two fellow Germans and we met with a Russian Open Data expert and Russian Goethe Institute staff. The [panel discussion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8I5BrU_FVA) (German, dubbed) was interesting, the people were great and I enjoyed the stay a alot.
