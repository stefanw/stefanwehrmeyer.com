I was invited for the Hackathon at the [15th International Anti-Corruption Conference](http://15iacc.org/) in Brasília. Together with the Transparency Hackers of Brazil we stayed in the Hacker House, drove around with the Hacker bus and built cool things related to corruption prevention.

I built [FOIReminder](https://github.com/stefanw/foireminder), a software that reminds you to make regual inquiries about a topic using one of the national FOI portals. [I deployed a version](http://foireminder.fragdenstaat.de/), but the idea never took off. I think it needs some more context or specific use cases.

After Brasília I stayed a couple of days in São Paulo.
