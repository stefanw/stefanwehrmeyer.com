[A friend of mine](http://www.freenerd.de/) co-organized the Music Hack Day in Reykjavik â€“ an excellent excuse to visit Iceland.
At the Hack Day I built [Bakgrunn](http://stefanwehrmeyer.com/projects/bakgrunn/) a soundscape of the University of Reykjavik together with Elisa. We actually won the SoundCloud price (due to lack of other projects using SoundCloud).

After the Music Hack Day we travelled around Iceland with friends and enjoyed food, waterfalls, geysirs, hot pots, hot tubs and northern lights.
