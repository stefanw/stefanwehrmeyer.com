Bundes-Git (Federal Git) is a Git repository of all Federal laws and regulations. I basically tried to version-control the laws after they were published which is more complicated that it sounds for various reasons. [Here's a talk I gave at Git Merge about Bundes-Git](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qql1Ess7qM).

The tool as such never took off beyond the usual crowd. At least some pull requests by the pirate party. But the concept resonated with many people. The Bundes-Git OctoEagle logo and the strategically reserved GitHub organizations "bundestag" and "bundesregierung" apparently made some believe that it's actually the German Parliament who's doing this. It's not, but if they ever want to use GitHub, I will surely add them to the organization!
