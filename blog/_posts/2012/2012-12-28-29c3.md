At the 29th Chaos Communication Congress I gave [yet another talk about the FOI portal FragDenStaat.de](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/Fahrplan/events/5262.en.html) and what we have been doing for the past year.

Friedrich Lindenberg and I also gave a talk about OffenesParlament and BundesGit with the catchy title [chmod o+rw bundestag](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/Fahrplan/events/5263.en.html).
