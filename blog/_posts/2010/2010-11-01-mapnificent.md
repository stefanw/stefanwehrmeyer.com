Mapnificent started with the wish to have a [Mapumental](http://mapumental.com/) for Berlin and its name is a clear hommage to the mysociety project. After some attempts (brute-force! scraping!) I launched a Mapnificent version that works with GTFS data and was therefore able to provide travel time visualizations for many cities around the world.

The coolest thing about Mapnificent is that it calculates travel time in the browser by fetching all necessary data and then computing it in a Web Worker. Mapnificent needs a rewrite soon to keep it up with browser developments.

Now and then, I add another city that just started publishing GTFS data. Over the years I have connected with many people around the world who are as passionate for public transport as I am.
