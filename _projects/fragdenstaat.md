As part of the newly founded Open Knowledge Foundation Germany, we were discussing an FOI site similar to mysociety's [WhatDoTheyKnow.com](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/). Unfortunately, we couldn't acquire funding and at the time the WhatDoTheyKnow code was not suitable to use outside of the UK.

So I wrote my own FOI portal software called [Froide](http://stefanw.github.io/froide/) that powers [the German Freedom of Information portal FragDenStaat.de](https://fragdenstaat.de/) since August 2011.

I ran FragDenStaat.de as project lead until 2014. I continue to maintain and improve the software. FOI in Germany is still comparatively weak compared to many other countries, but has seen a big rise in requests since the launch of FragDenStaat.de.

The software is Django-based, written in English and also powers the Austrian FOI portal.
